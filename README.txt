pylinex is a Python package for linear extraction of signals from data. It is flexible enough to perform most any linear fit to data but was created with the purpose of using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to create models of components of data with which to separate those components. This package was introduced along with a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal (***UPDATE WITH CITATION***).

The dependencies for this package are

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
distpy (https://bitbucket.org/ktausch/distpy)
h5py

All code in this package is compatible with Python 2.7+ and Python 3.5+.
